# E-R model

The **entity-relationship(E-R)** data model models an enterprise as a collection of entities and relationships that represents the overall logical structure of a database.

The E-R data model employs three basic components:
- [[notes/Entity sets]]
- [[notes/Relationship sets]]
- [[notes/Attributes(E-R)]]

The E-R model also has an associated diagrammatic representation called the **E-R diagram**, which can express the overall logical structure of a database graphically.
